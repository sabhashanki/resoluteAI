      " Logo of  Revolutionary Girl Utena \n",
      " \n",
      " Revolutionary Girl Utena  is a 1997 Japanese  anime  television series created by  Be-Papas , a production group formed by director  Kunihiko Ikuhara . The series follows Utena Tenjou, a teenaged girl drawn into a  sword dueling  tournament to win the hand of a mysterious girl who possesses the \"power to revolutionize the world\". Ikuhara was a director on  the television anime adaptation  of  Sailor Moon , and conceived  Utena  in response to a lack of creative control in directing an adapted work.  Utena  has been described as a deconstruction and subversion of  fairy tales  and the  magical-girl  genre, making use of  avant-garde  and  surrealist  elements to comment on themes of gender, sexuality, and coming of age. The series received domestic and international critical acclaim, particularly for its treatment of  LGBT  themes and subject material, and has influenced subsequent animated works. In 1999,  Adolescence of Utena  was released as a follow-up film to the series. ( Full article... )\n",

      " State Fair  is a 1933 American comedy-drama film directed by  Henry King  and starring  Janet Gaynor ,  Will Rogers  and  Lew Ayres . It was based on the 1932 bestselling novel  State Fair  by  Phil Stong . The picture tells the story of a farm family's multi-day visit to the  Iowa State Fair , where the parents seek to win prizes in agricultural and cooking competitions, and their teenage daughter and son each find unexpected romance. The film was made in  pre-Code Hollywood  and, despite its seemingly tame plot, had some scenes that were censored in a re-release a few years later, after the  Production Code  took effect. Cut scenes include a view of a disheveled bed and a  negligee  on the floor, and a sexual relationship between the daughter and a reporter, but the son's seduction by a trapeze artist was kept. The film was nominated for an  Academy Award for Best Picture  and was the first of three film versions of the novel released to theaters, the others being  movie musicals released in 1945  and  in 1962 . This poster was produced for the 1933 theatrical release of  State Fair .\n",
